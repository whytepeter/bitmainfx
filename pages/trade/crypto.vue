        <p>A cryptocurrency like bitcoin is a virtual currency traded peer-to-peer on a blockchain, independent of centralized authorities like banks and governments. Cryptocurrencies are entirely virtual, so they are not backed by physical commodities and have no intrinsic value.</p>

        <p>Primarily, cryptocurrencies rely on blockchain technology to complete a transaction via an intricate P2P network. Once a transfer request is entered into the network, it is validated by the network and added to a pool of other transactions to create a block of data for the ledger, which is then entered into the existing blockchain. Once the block is successfully added to the chain, the transaction is approved and completed.</p>
